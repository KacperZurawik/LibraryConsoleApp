### :warning:Application is still in progress!:warning:

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in building real-world applications using C# and .NET.
At the same time, the application simulates a simple library system and includes features like:

   - add a book
   - issue a book
   - show all books
   - searching for users
   - show issued books
   
#    Technology Stack
- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET 4.7.2
- Database: currently none

#   Project Goals
 
In addition, the project was created as part of my learning journey. Its purpose is also to:
Practice and improve skills in C# programming
   - understand and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
   - learn the structure and organization of a multi-layered application
   - follow good coding practices and improve code readability
   - to develop a clean, maintainable, and extendable code.
   - gain experience with .NET Framework as a foundation before moving on to modern .NET (.NET 6/8)
   - gain experience working with Git and GitHub
   - learn how to write clear and useful technical documentation

#   Future Plans

   - database integration (thinking of SQL lite)
   - implement logging
   - add proper input validations (to ensure data consistency and robustness)
   - complete and polish currently unfinished features (e.g. returning books, better search, etc.)
   - add more like: DVD's etc. issue
