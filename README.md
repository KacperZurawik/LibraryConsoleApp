### :warning:Application is still in progress!:warning:

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in building real-world applications using C# and .NET.
At the same time, the application simulates a simple library system.

#    Technology Stack
- Language: C#
- Framework: .NET 4.7.2
- Database: currently none (Planned SQLite)

#   Project Goals
 
In addition, the project was created as part of my learning journey. Its purpose is also to:
Practice and improve skills in C# programming
   - understand and apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles
   - learn the structure and organization of a multi-layered application
   - follow good coding practices and improve code readability
   - to develop a clean, maintainable, and extendable code.
   - gain experience with .NET Framework as a foundation before moving on to modern .NET (.NET 6/8)
   - gain experience working with Git and GitHub
   - learn how to write clear and useful technical documentation

## Features
